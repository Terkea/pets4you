Almost 6.5 million animals enter shelters worldwide and 1.5 of which are euthanized. Adopting allows these animals to experience life again.
Pets for you is an online application meant to help find shelter to stray pets. The application was built using React.js and Firebase.

### bucket rules

```
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

database rules

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write;
    }
  }
}
```

# Firebase router

You need to make sure the rewrites are enabled in your Firebase hosting configuration to redirect all requests to your index.html file. This assumes you are using create-react-app:

```
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ],
    "headers": [
      {"source": "/service-worker.js", "headers": [{"key": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache"}]}
    ]
  }
}
```
